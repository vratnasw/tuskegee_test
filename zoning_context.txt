- Various types of care facilities (except those specifically permitted)
- Commercial and business uses
- Industrial uses

- Agricultural uses beyond typical residential gardening

These regulations are designed to maintain the low-density residential character of the R1 district, allowing primarily for single-family homes with some limited additional uses. The setbacks, lot size, and width requirements help ensure adequate spacing between homes and maintain the residential nature of the area.

The regulations permit single-family dwellings and duplexes, as well as some conditional and special exception uses like day care homes and schools.


Based on the information provided in the zoning ordinance for the City of Tuskegee, the requirements for the B1 (Central Business District) are as follows:

1. Minimum Lot Size: 
   - Must be of sufficient size to provide adequate space required for normal operation of uses permitted.

2. Minimum Lot Width:
   - Must be of sufficient size to provide adequate space required for normal operation of uses permitted.

3. Front Yard Setback: 
   - 0 feet (The property line is the required build-to line)

4. Rear Yard Setback: 
   - 20 feet

5. Side Yard Setback: 
   - 0 feet (The property line is the required build-to line)

6. Maximum Building Height: 
   - 45 feet

These requirements are designed to allow for a dense, mixed-use commercial area in the city center. The lack of front and side yard setbacks allows buildings to be constructed right up to the property line, creating a more urban environment. The taller building height allowance accommodates multi-story buildings with possible residential or office uses above ground-floor commercial spaces.

The regulations permit a wide variety of commercial uses, offices, and some residential uses like upper story apartments. However, single-family dwellings and some other residential types are not permitted in this district. This zoning designation aims to create a vibrant downtown area with a mix of business, retail, and some residential uses.
